# StepUpOnto SKSE - NPC Pathing Patch V2

Companion compatibility build of **StepUpOnto SKSE** for use with
[Modern NPC Pathing / NPC Pathing NG](https://github.com/ShugokiFable/Modern-NPC-Pathing).

Upstream: [StepUpOnto SKSE (Nexus 175689)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/175689) by **TheShinyHaxorus**.

## What V2 changes

While a SkyParkour animation is driving an actor (player parkour, or NPC parkour via NPC Pathing NG),
the character controller can read as "grounded and not moving" - which is exactly StepUpOnto's step trigger.
The original could fire its step-warp mid climb/vault and fight parkour alignment.

This build checks the `SkyParkourOngoing` animation graph variable in both the player and NPC step gates
and stays hands-off until the parkour move finishes.

That is the only behavior change. Internally, SimpleIni was replaced with a built-in INI reader/writer
(same file, same keys, same format).

## Installation

1. Install original StepUpOnto SKSE (or have it already).
2. Install this patch **after** it so `StepUpOntoSKSE.dll` overwrites.
3. Keep your existing `StepUpOntoSKSE.ini` - settings continue to work.

Without SkyParkour, behavior matches the original.

Requirements: Skyrim SE/AE, SKSE64, Address Library.
